Baby Cthulu is an abstraction interface and management engine.

Throw the .cpp's in tests into a template devkit working project and you'll have
for one of them you'll need a copy of the data files to serve as test sprites.

The 3D tests show the currently limited functionality of the engine.

Sprite capabilities are pretty solid. Multiple sprites of varying sizes can be:
 *Blitted anywhere on the screen
 *Have Alpha channels and such
 *Be animated
 *Stopped

I will add more functionality as I think of it. Esepcially while adding BG
functionality and such. Trying to make the engine compact but useful for users
in the same way Game Maker was useful in making neat nethack like RPG's. 
(Man I want to learn to play that game so bad now...)

Anywho. Enjoi what I've got so far. Try out what you can. Break it send in bugs.

* CTHULU Basics

----------------------------


1.1 bcthulu Nodes.
Baby Cthulu is first and foremost an API. Thus you must have an access method.
The functions of the babyCthulu interface can be seen in the source.

To create a handle to babyCthulu use the call "bluCreate()" to return a
reference to the babycthulu interface. This is done as so:

	bcthulu* blu = bluCreate();

After this call blu will have a reference to babyCthulu. And will be able to
make calls to the interface.

blu->GFX_Initiate() or Input will begin to initialize the graphics engines and 
will
be ready to handle input and 2D. 

1.2 Graphics
As of currently babyCthulu only handles sprite memory. On could theoretically 
add lower level code to access bg's until this functionality is added.

Graphics memory can be initiated. It has not been implemented however.

1.2.1 Sprites
Lets first  take a look at the sprite memory. Using previous knowledge from the
DS architecture we know that OMA memory has 128 active spaces to hold sprites
of any shape size or format. (Unlike it's predecessor the gba which did not
have enough memory to full implement OAM). 

Lets look at some specs before diving into cthulu
	*0680:0000 is the VRAM base of a total of 656KB. Libnds breaks this up 
	 into 9 banks. 
		Bank A - B: 128KB
		Bank E: 64KB
		Bank F & G: 16KB
		Bank H: 32KB
		Bank I: 16KB
	This spans all of VRAM @680:0000. One needs to map virtual VRAM pointer 
        addresses to the real VRAM for the 2D engine to operate. This is done
	with setBank(parameters);

	That is not in the scope of this manual and if you have not learned it
	you should not be using cthulu.

Babycthulu will automatically set the memory banks dependning on what you're
going to craft in terms of it's the engines. The default initiate will
set the Bank A to the start of sprite memory, and Bank B to the BG.

So to get ready to make sprites go ahead and call blu->GFX_Inititate(); 
Onto the sprite structures. Baby Cthulu handles all sprite data in memory
using structures that represents a fully animated sprite. (This is an advanced
feature, the animation). Go take a look in the babyCthulu header file about
what data you can set into the sprite:
		
		struct bluSprite{
		int init;
		int frame;
		int framerate;
		int counter;
		int x;
		int y;
		int fps;
		int id;
		int priority;
		unsigned short* gfx;
		const unsigned int* tiles;
		const unsigned short* pal;
		unsigned int tlen;
		unsigned int plen;
		SpriteMapping sm;
		SpriteSize sz;
		SpriteColorFormat sfmt;
		};

All of these should be self explanatory (save init, set init to 0 before 
initializing a sprite and it will be set to 1. Do not mess with it after. Set 
frame the framerate and counter to 0 as well). 

Framerate is not a real FPS. The higher this number the slower the animation 
will play the lower the faster it will play. 

Everything else should be explanatory. 

After you construct a struct, pass a reference to it to LDSprite(); this will 
cause the sprite to go into memory. From here you my BltSpr() it.

I do not have time to finish this. Do not be a n00b Patrick.
