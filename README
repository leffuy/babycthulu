Baby Cthulu is an abstraction interface and management engine.

Throw the .cpp's in tests into a template devkit working project and you'll have
for one of them you'll need a copy of the data files to serve as test sprites.

The 3D tests show the currently limited functionality of the engine.

Sprite capabilities are pretty solid. Multiple sprites of varying sizes can be:
 *Blitted anywhere on the screen
 *Have Alpha channels and such
 *Be animated
 *Stopped

I will add more functionality as I think of it. Esepcially while adding BG
functionality and such. Trying to make the engine compact but useful for users
in the same way Game Maker was useful in making neat nethack like RPG's. 
(Man I want to learn to play that game so bad now...)

Anywho. Enjoi what I've got so far. Try out what you can. Break it send in bugs.
